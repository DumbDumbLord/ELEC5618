1. Overview

Freeplane is a software designed to help users create mind maps.  It is a tool that helps users organise their thoughts, plans and ideas. 
Target audience for the software are individuals and teams who need a visual representation of information to communicate information or develop them. 
This can include students, project managers, educators, and researchers. The skill level to use freeplane is very low and very user friendly,
