1. Configuration Items

Ⅰ.Configuration Items to be Managed

1. Software Source Code
1）Located in the /freeplane/src/ directory, written in Java.
2）Requires version tracking to support collaborative development, issue tracing, and rollback if necessary.

2.Documentation
1)Includes the README.md, user manuals, developer guides and design documents in the /freeplane/doc/ directory.
2)These documents must be versioned to ensure that user and developer information stays aligned with software updates.

3.Test Cases and Scripts
1)Stored in testing-related directories such as /freeplane/src/test/.
2)Unit tests and regression tests are essential for ensuring software reliability.

4.Build Configurations
1)Includes build scripts that automate compilation and packaging.
2)Any changes to build tools or settings must be managed carefully.

Ⅱ. Tools and Processes for Configuration Management
1.Version Control System: Git is used to track all changes to source code, documents, and configurations. Development is done on feature branches merged via pull requests after peer review.
2.Change Management System: GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are used to manage bugs, enhancements, and updates.
3.Continuous Integration Tools: Jenkins or GitHub Actions automatically build and test the software on every commit.

Ⅲ. Roles and Responsibilities
1.Configuration Manager: Oversees the integrity of configuration items and ensures proper versioning.
2.Developers: Implement features, write code, and submit changes via pull requests.
3.Testers: Maintain and execute test cases, validate bug fixes.
4.Project Maintainer: Approves major changes and coordinates team efforts.

Ⅳ. Release / Change Management Process
1. Change Identification: Issues or feature requests are logged on GitHub.
2. Review and Approval: Pull requests are submitted and reviewed by maintainers.
3. Versioning and Release: Approved changes are tagged with semantic versioning.
4. Distribution: Releases are published via GitHub and official website.
5. Rollback: Previous stable versions are archived for emergency rollback.

2. Tools & Processes

1. Git: A distributed version control system used to manage source code and documents. Git supports branch-based workflows, enabling parallel development and controlled integration.
2. GitHub: Hosts the project repository and provides tools for issue tracking, pull requests, and release tagging.
3. GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool used to automate builds and tests for each code push or pull request, ensuring immediate feedback.
4. Issue Tracking and Change Management: GitHub Issues is used to track bugs, enhancement requests, and documentation updates. Each issue can be assigned, prioritized, and linked to code changes.
5. Release Management: GitHub Releases are used to publish precompiled binaries with release notes, changelogs, and version tags, ensuring traceability and rollback support.

3. Roles & Responsibilities
- Development Team:
  - Responsible for implementing new features and fixing bugs in the core application.
  - Team members work on specific modules such as the UI layer, mind map engine, or file export/import functionalities.
  - Focused on writing maintainable code, following code review protocols, and ensuring their changes do not break existing functionality.
 
- Testing/QA Team:
  - Designs and maintains unit tests and integration tests.
  - Executes test suites before releases to ensure stability.
  - Focused on validating features, catching regressions, and reporting issues.
 
- Documentation Team:
  - Prepares and updates user manuals, developer guides, and configuration references.
  - Ensures that documentation reflects the latest software state.
  - Focused on accessibility, clarity, and accuracy of documentation.
 
- Configuration Manager / Project Maintainer:
  - Oversees the integrity of all configuration items.
  - Approves pull requests, manages version tagging and release cycles.
  - Ensures the configuration management process is followed by all contributors.

4. Release Management
Release Process Overview
Code Submission Process: Freeplane uses GitHub as its primary code repository, which suggests a typical Git-based workflow. Developers fork the repository, create feature branches, and submit pull requests (PRs) to the freeplane/freeplane repository. The "Pull Requests" tab shows active and merged PRs, indicating that code submissions are reviewed before integration into the main branch.
Release Creation: The "Releases" tab (e.g., Releases · freeplane/freeplane) lists stable and pre-release versions. Releases are tagged (e.g., v1.11.stick sticktick, alpha-1.9.0-pre05), indicating that maintainers create releases manually by tagging a stable state of the codebase. Assets like ZIP files and source code archives are attached to these releases.

File Management in the Release Process
Organization: Files are versioned and bundled into archives, ensuring all necessary components (e.g., Java classes, documentation) are included. The repository’s root contains build scripts (e.g., Gradle files), suggesting that releases are built systematically before tagging.
Artifacts: Release assets include compiled binaries (e.g., freeplane_bin-1.11.14.zip) and source code (e.g., Source code (zip)). These are uploaded to GitHub Releases, providing a centralized location for distribution.

Stable Version Rollback
Mechanism: GitHub’s release tagging system allows rollback to any previous tagged version (e.g., v1.11.13, v1.11.12). Users can download older release assets from the Releases page if a newer version introduces instability. The Git history enables maintainers to revert commits if needed, though this would require creating a new release tag.
Evidence: The availability of past releases (e.g., v1.9.14 and earlier) on the Releases page suggests rollback is feasible by redistributing or rebuilding from a prior tag.

File Name Design Principles
Pattern: Release file names follow a consistent convention: freeplane_bin-<version>.zip (e.g., freeplane_bin-1.11.14.zip) for binaries and freeplane-<version>.tar.gz for source code. Pre-releases use prefixes like alpha- or pre- (e.g., alpha-1.9.0-pre05).
Logic: The naming includes: Project name (freeplane): Identifies the software.Artifact type (bin for binary): Clarifies the file’s purpose.Version number (1.11.14): Follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). This ensures traceability and clarity for users downloading releases.

5. Change Management
Submitting a Change Request
Pull Requests: Code and documentation changes are submitted via PRs. The freeplane directory includes doc and various plugin directories (e.g., freeplane_plugin_latex), indicating that both code and documentation changes are managed in the repository. Contributors fork, make changes, and open PRs.
Issues: The "Issues" tab on GitHub (e.g., bug #2301, feature request #2298 as of early 2025) allows users to report bugs or request features, serving as change requests.

Analyzing the Impact
The build.gradle file suggests automated testing (likely via Gradle tasks), ensuring changes don’t break the build. The freeplane_plugin_script_test directory indicates specific tests for plugins, helping assess impact.

Approval
PRs are reviewed by maintainers, as evidenced by merged PRs in the commit history. The .github directory likely contains workflows for automated checks (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) that must pass before approval.

Implementation
The format_translation_gradle and signjar-example.properties files suggest that changes may involve updating translations or signing JARs, which are part of the build process.
