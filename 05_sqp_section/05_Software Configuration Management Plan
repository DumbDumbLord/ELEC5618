1. Configuration Items

Ⅰ.Configuration Items to be Managed

1. Software Source Code
1）Located in the /freeplane/src/ directory, written in Java.
2）Requires version tracking to support collaborative development, issue tracing, and rollback if necessary.

2.Documentation
1)Includes the README.md, user manuals, developer guides and design documents in the /freeplane/doc/ directory.
2)These documents must be versioned to ensure that user and developer information stays aligned with software updates.

3.Test Cases and Scripts
1)Stored in testing-related directories such as /freeplane/src/test/.
2)Unit tests and regression tests are essential for ensuring software reliability.

4.Build Configurations
1)Includes build scripts that automate compilation and packaging.
2)Any changes to build tools or settings must be managed carefully.

Ⅱ. Tools and Processes for Configuration Management
1.Version Control System: Git is used to track all changes to source code, documents, and configurations. Development is done on feature branches merged via pull requests after peer review.
2.Change Management System: GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are used to manage bugs, enhancements, and updates.
3.Continuous Integration Tools: Jenkins or GitHub Actions automatically build and test the software on every commit.

Ⅲ. Roles and Responsibilities
1.Configuration Manager: Oversees the integrity of configuration items and ensures proper versioning.
2.Developers: Implement features, write code, and submit changes via pull requests.
3.Testers: Maintain and execute test cases, validate bug fixes.
4.Project Maintainer: Approves major changes and coordinates team efforts.

Ⅳ. Release / Change Management Process
1. Change Identification: Issues or feature requests are logged on GitHub.
2. Review and Approval: Pull requests are submitted and reviewed by maintainers.
3. Versioning and Release: Approved changes are tagged with semantic versioning.
4. Distribution: Releases are published via GitHub and official website.
5. Rollback: Previous stable versions are archived for emergency rollback.

2. Tools & Processes

1. Git: A distributed version control system used to manage source code and documents. Git supports branch-based workflows, enabling parallel development and controlled integration.
2. GitHub: Hosts the project repository and provides tools for issue tracking, pull requests, and release tagging.
3. GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool used to automate builds and tests for each code push or pull request, ensuring immediate feedback.
4. Issue Tracking and Change Management: GitHub Issues is used to track bugs, enhancement requests, and documentation updates. Each issue can be assigned, prioritized, and linked to code changes.
5. Release Management: GitHub Releases are used to publish precompiled binaries with release notes, changelogs, and version tags, ensuring traceability and rollback support.

3. Roles & Responsibilities
- Development Team:
  - Responsible for implementing new features and fixing bugs in the core application.
  - Team members work on specific modules such as the UI layer, mind map engine, or file export/import functionalities.
  - Focused on writing maintainable code, following code review protocols, and ensuring their changes do not break existing functionality.
 
- Testing/QA Team:
  - Designs and maintains unit tests and integration tests.
  - Executes test suites before releases to ensure stability.
  - Focused on validating features, catching regressions, and reporting issues.
 
- Documentation Team:
  - Prepares and updates user manuals, developer guides, and configuration references.
  - Ensures that documentation reflects the latest software state.
  - Focused on accessibility, clarity, and accuracy of documentation.
 
- Configuration Manager / Project Maintainer:
  - Oversees the integrity of all configuration items.
  - Approves pull requests, manages version tagging and release cycles.
  - Ensures the configuration management process is followed by all contributors.
