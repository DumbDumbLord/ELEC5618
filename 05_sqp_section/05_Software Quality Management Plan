     It could be measured by conducting cross-platform testing and document results. It expands user base across different operating systems and could be achieved by addressing platform-specific issues identified during testing.
     It could be implemented within three months.
  d. Redesign the user interface to simplify navigation and improve accessibility to enhance usability.
     It could be measured by users' feedback through surveys and usability testing. It increases user engagement and satisfaction and could be achieved by collaborating with UX/UI designers to implement changes.
     This should be completed within 3 months.
  e. Refactor legacy code to improve readability and modularity to enhance maintainabolity.
     It could be measured by tracking the reduction in code complexity metrics. It facilitates easier future development and debugging and could be allocated dedicated time for refactoring during each sprint.
     It should be achieved within three months.
  f. Ensure the application runs seamlessly on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems to improve portability.
     It could be measured by test and document performance on different system architectures.
     It Expands accessibility to a broader range of users and could be modified codebase to address compatibility issues.
     It should be achieved within three months.
