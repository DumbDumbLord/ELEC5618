**Project's_QA_Items_Mechanism**
Part 1
1. The three functionalities are clearly described from what the user does with the
product.

2. The figure contains the main components of the project (not more than 10) and
the relations among them.

3. The list contains the most important data structures of the product (not more
than 10) and their relationship.
- Mind Map Tree (MindMap)
Contains the root node, which represents the mind map and its hierarchy, as all other nodes attached can be checked with the root node.
- Node (Node)
The main component of the mind map can outline an idea or concept. Allows the creation of child nodes and setting connectors to another node. It also stores all its attributes and may be set in a style.
- Attributes Container (Attributes)
Attribute containers are attached nodes, each defining a name and value of the attribute. 
- Connector (Connector)
Connector between two nodes, other than direct parent-child nodes.
- Node Style Definition (NodeStyle)
Contains the style of the node and nodes can be set to. Can be searched for in MindMap.
- Undo/Redo Command Stack (Controller)
Controller of the model/mind map, allows setting/loading the mindmap, edits nodes and redo/undo commands. Mainly for supporting user actions on mindmap and for controller design patterns. 

Part 2
4. Review and Suggestion on three functionalities.

5. Discussion on figure.

6. Discussion on the list of most important data structures.
Dynamic Scripting & Automation
Dynamic Scripting simplifies node creation and automates repetitive tasks of data import/exports and sorting node attributes/styles. Controller allows the input and export of mindmap and also dynamic undo and redo commands. Node contains a simplified process to create child nodes.

Conditional Formatting & Data Recognition
Conditional formatting is applied to nodes (Node) causing changes to the node’s attributes (Attributes) or style (NodeStyle). Controller should be able to find/fetch the nodes from Mindmap and adjust the nodes’ attributes (Attributes) or style (NodeStyle), hence allowing for conditional formatting.

Advanced Navigation & Iterative Filtering
Controller is able to find/navigate nodes with a specific property using the Mindmap’s filtering function that filters nodes and allows searching for the nodes. Mindmap also searches and allows the retrieval of node styles in the mindmap, hence being able to filter based on style.
