QA Mechanism Details
Documentation:
• Regularly reviewed & updated to reflect the current state of
the product.
• Prevents “out-of-date” instructions that might introduce new
defects.
Training:
• Train team members on product design,
manufacturing/implementation processes, and safety
standards.
• Ensures everyone has the knowledge to identify & address
potential defects early.
Policies:
• Summarize the written guidelines governing the project’s
design, coding standards, and manufacturing processes.
• Keep them updated so they align with current best practices
and regulatory requirements.
Tests:
• Conduct rigorous testing (design validation, manufacturing
validation, product verification).
• Catch potential defects before release. May include unit tests,
integration tests, system tests, etc.
Measures:
• Monitor and measure key performance indicators (defect rates,
customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance).
• Use these metrics to refine and improve the QA process
continuously.
