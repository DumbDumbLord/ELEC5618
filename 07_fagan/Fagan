Functionality
- Does the software design implement the specifications and requirements? 
- Are the specifications and requirements complete for the users?
- Is the design functionality consistent?
- Does the design support key features like exporting mind maps to various formats (e.g., PDF, PNG, HTML)? 
- Are collaborative features (if any) well-defined and implemented as per user requirements?

Performance
- Does the design represent works for the all specified operating environment?
  - Windows?
  - MAC?
  - Linux?
- Does the software run without error?
- Are the primary performance requirements specified?
- Are the performance requirements such as being able to operate on the minimum hardware requirements met (2Hz cpu, 1GB RAM)?
- Are there mechanisms to optimize performance during real-time updates (e.g., auto-saving or live collaboration)?
- Does the application handle large mind maps (e.g., 10,000+ nodes) without significant lag?

Interface
- Does the interface facilitates troubleshooting?
- Do all the interfaces provide the required information?
- Are all the interfaces consistent with the requirements?
- Is the interface appealing to look at?
- Is the interface easy to navigate?
- Are all buttons and other inputs clear and unambiguous?
- Are all text and labels clear and unambiguous?
- Is the interface easy to navigate?
- Are all buttons and other inputs clear and unambiguous?
- Are all text and labels clear and unambiguous?
- Does the interface support accessibility features (e.g., screen reader compatibility, high-contrast modes)?

Data Usage
- Is there any data structure needed that has not been defined?
- Are all objects, relationships, and parameter documented?
- Are there safeguards for data integrity during operations like undo/redo or file recovery?
Logic
- Are all the actions taken correctly in all cases?
- Is there proper handling of external data imports (e.g., from other mind mapping tools like FreeMind)
- Are there any logical inconsistencies in feature interactions (e.g., conflicts between formatting and filtering)?
- Are conditional behaviors (e.g., filtering nodes, applying styles based on rules) implemented correctly?

Testability
- Can the software programs be tested in an incremental manner?
- Can the module that this design describes be tested or inspected to show that it satisfies the requirements?
- Is the software thoroughly tested?
- Are there mechanisms to test performance under stress (e.g., opening multiple large mind maps simultaneously)?
- Are there sufficient test cases for cross-platform compatibility (e.g., rendering differences on Linux vs. Windows)?
- Can automated tests validate user interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts)?

Documentation
- Is the software well documented?
- Is the installation well documented?
- Does the documentation reflect the latest version of Freeplane (e.g., 1.11.14 as of May 14, 2024)?
- Does the documentation accurately describe Freeplane’s system requirements (e.g., Java 11 or later for version 1.11.4)?
- Is the documentation available in multiple languages, reflecting Freeplane’s supported languages (e.g., English, German, Spanish, Chinese)?
- Is the documentation accessible offline (e.g., as a downloadable PDF or bundled with the Freeplane installation)?
- Are there regular updates to the documentation to reflect new features or community contributions (e.g., add-ons, scripts)?
