Functionality
- Does the software design implement the specifications and requirements? Yes 
  The repository’s modular, plugin-based structure clearly implements the core functionalities expected of Freeplane.
- Are the specifications and requirements complete for the users? Yes
  For individual mind mapping, knowledge management, and project management, the specifications are comprehensive, though advanced real-time collaboration is not a focus.
- Is the design functionality consistent? Yes
  The consistent coding practices and clear modular separation throughout the codebase support reliable functionality.
- Does the design support key features like exporting mind maps to various formats (e.g., PDF, PNG, HTML)? Yes
  Yes – The design includes dedicated export plugins (such as for SVG) that indicate support for exporting; additional formats may be supported or extended via similar modules.
- Are collaborative features (if any) well-defined and implemented as per user requirements? No
  The application is primarily designed for single-user productivity, and integrated real-time collaboration features are not a core part of its design.
Performance
- Does the design represent works for the all specified operating environment?
  - Windows?
  - MAC?
  - Linux?
- Does the software run without error?
- Are the primary performance requirements specified?
- Are the performance requirements such as being able to operate on the minimum hardware requirements met (2Hz cpu, 1GB RAM)?
- Are there mechanisms to optimize performance during real-time updates (e.g., auto-saving or live collaboration)?
- Does the application handle large mind maps (e.g., 10,000+ nodes) without significant lag?

Interface
- Does the interface facilitates troubleshooting?
- Do all the interfaces provide the required information?
- Are all the interfaces consistent with the requirements?
- Is the interface appealing to look at?
- Is the interface easy to navigate?
- Are all buttons and other inputs clear and unambiguous?
- Are all text and labels clear and unambiguous?
- Is the interface easy to navigate?Yes
- Are all buttons and other inputs clear and unambiguous?Yes
- Are all text and labels clear and unambiguous?Yes
- Does the interface support accessibility features (e.g., screen reader compatibility, high-contrast modes)?No

Data Usage
- Is there any data structure needed that has not been defined? Yes
- Are all objects, relationships, and parameter documented? No
- Are there safeguards for data integrity during operations like undo/redo or file recovery? Yes
- Is there proper handling of external data imports (e.g., from other mind mapping tools like FreeMind) Yes
Logic
- Are all the actions taken correctly in all cases? No
- Does the logic support scripting or automation features (e.g., Groovy scripts in Freeplane) without errors? Yes
- Are there any logical inconsistencies in feature interactions (e.g., conflicts between formatting and filtering)? No
- Are conditional behaviors (e.g., filtering nodes, applying styles based on rules) implemented correctly? Yes

Testability
- Can the software programs be tested in an incremental manner? Yes
- Can the module that this design describes be tested or inspected to show that it satisfies the requirements? Yes
- Is the software thoroughly tested? No
- Are there mechanisms to test performance under stress (e.g., opening multiple large mind maps simultaneously)? No
- Are there sufficient test cases for cross-platform compatibility (e.g., rendering differences on Linux vs. Windows)? No
- Can automated tests validate user interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts)? No

Documentation
- Is the software well documented? Yes
- Is the installation well documented? Yes
- Does the documentation reflect the latest version of Freeplane (e.g., 1.11.14 as of May 14, 2024)? No
- Does the documentation accurately describe Freeplane’s system requirements (e.g., Java 11 or later for version 1.11.4)? Yes
- Is the documentation available in multiple languages, reflecting Freeplane’s supported languages (e.g., English, German, Spanish, Chinese)? Yes
- Is the documentation accessible offline (e.g., as a downloadable PDF or bundled with the Freeplane installation)? Yes
- Are there regular updates to the documentation to reflect new features or community contributions (e.g., add-ons, scripts)? Yes
