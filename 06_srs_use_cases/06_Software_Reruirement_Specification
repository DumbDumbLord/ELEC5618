1.5 Document Overview


Overall Description
2.1 Product perspective

Freeplane is a free and open-source mind mapping tool. It comes from another project called FreeMind. 
You can use Freeplane to draw maps that help you plan, organize ideas, and manage knowledge.
Freeplane works on computers with Windows, macOS, or Linux. It does not need the internet or a server to run. You can use it by itself. 
If you are an advanced user, you can also add extra tools, plugins, or write scripts to do more things.You can use Freeplane alone. 
It does not need other software to work. But it can work with other tools. For example, you can export maps and open them in PDF or HTML. 
You can also write scripts to connect it with other programs.
Freeplane is one part of many tools used for thinking, learning, or working.
It can open and save maps in different formats, like PDF, HTML, Markdown, and OPML. This helps you share your work with other software.
This document (called SRS) explains what Freeplane should do, how it should work, and what limits it has. It helps developers build, test, and improve the software.

2.4 Operating Environment
There are no specific hardware requirements on the program and can run on all modern operating systems (windows, mac & linux). Assumed recommended requirements:
CPU, 2 GHz or higher (better performance)
RAM, 1 GB or more (smoother when working with big mind maps)
Storage, 200 MB or more (for installation and more depends on mind maps)
Graphics, enough to handle basic 2d rendering

The software requirements for the system requires an embedded java distribution in the installer or independently java 11 or later needs to be installed (preferably java 11 or 17). [1] 
Without an installer and using git clone, ‘gradle’ additionally with java needs to be installed to build the program.

The program is mainly an offline local application and may only need the network to check for updates.


2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies (Tips: Assumptions are the prerequisites that we
take for granted when designing requirements. For example, for a certain function, do
you think users need to have certain prerequisite capabilities before using it? )

System features (Each student should provide one feature)
Feature 1:
3.1.1 Feature name
Node Creation in Mind map

3.1.2 Description
Allows the user to create and edit a visual mind map represented by nodes which helps organise their ideas, information or plans. 

3.1.3 Functional Requirements
3.1.3.1 Create Nodes in Mind Map
Clicking on the add nodes button will create a new node on the currently selected node.
Input: add node button press
Output: new child node to selected node

3.1.3.2 Edit Content of Existing Nodes
Clicking the node selects the node. Double clicking nodes allows editing the content of the node
Input: Double Clicking
Process: Editing the node, can change text with addition to its font size, text alignment and bold/italic.
Output: Content of Node changes

3.1.4 Performance Requirements
3.1.4.1 Response/Rendering Time for Node Creation/updates
Should be responsive and be below 1s to create nodes and update the new node content.

3.1.4.2 Efficient or Sufficient Memory 
Should be able to create render and add nodes without lag, crashing or unable render content due lack of memory. 

3.1.5 Design constraints
3.1.5.1 Storage and Memory
Extra storage is needed to store the mind map file if the mind map is too big with a large number of nodes, it may require storage to be a problem with the software unable to store it. 
Low memory may also cause the software to be unable to load big mind maps with large numbers of nodes or lagging and crashing the software. These hardware constraints may cause the software to be unable to operate.

3.1.5.2 Operating Requirements
Java is needed to operate the software as the software is code in Java. This may only increase storage for the application as Java needs to be installed.

3.1.6 Quality Attributes
3.1.6.1 Usuability
Node creation should be used with ease and easy to navigate. The user should not be frustrated when navigating node creation and the software should be responsive enough to update new changes.

3.1.6.2 Maintainability 
Node creation should be well maintained, hence being easy to edit and open to changes and updates when issues arise or to be improved. 

-Feature 2:
3.2.1 Feature name
Filtering and Searching
3.2.2 Description
This function allows users to filter and search nodes in mind maps by keywords, attributes or conditional expressions. Its purpose is to help users quickly locate information from a large number of nodes, hide irrelevant content, and focus on specific tasks or content structures.
3.2.3 Functional Requirements
FR1: Keyword search function
Description: The system should allow users to enter keywords in the search box and highlight all nodes matching the keyword in the map.
Input: The user enters text in the search bar, such as "deadline".
Processing: The system searches for nodes containing the text in all nodes.
Output: Matching nodes are highlighted and their ancestor nodes are automatically expanded.
FR2: Conditional filter function
Description: The system should allow users to apply filter conditions (such as node priority, label, completion status) to display specific nodes.
Input: User selects a filter, such as priority == high
Processing: The system hides nodes that do not meet the requirements according to the conditions.
Output: Only nodes that meet the conditions and their ancestors/descendants are displayed, and other nodes are hidden.
3.2.4 Performance Requirements
PR1: Response time
For mind maps with no more than 1,000 nodes, the response time for search operations should be no more than 300 milliseconds, and for filter operations no more than 500 milliseconds.
PR2: Memory efficiency
The system should avoid memory leaks when performing filter operations, use lightweight data structures for filter states, and release cached data immediately after filtering is undone.
3.2.5 Design constraints
DC1: Platform compatibility constraints
The function must be compatible with the Java runtime environment (JRE 8 and above) to ensure that it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
DC2: Data structure restrictions
The filtering function must be implemented based on the existing NodeModel and MapModel data structures, and the introduction of new core node types is prohibited.
3.2.6 Quality Attributes
QA1:  Performance Search and filter operations should be completed within 1 second (for less than 1,000 nodes) to ensure high interactive response speed.
