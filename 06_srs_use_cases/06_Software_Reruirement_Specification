Introduction
1.1 Purpose(Tips: Who may want to see this SRS document and why they see it?)

The Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is a guide for the software that is under development and maintained. 
The intended audience for the document should mainly be stakeholders of the project, hence the owners, development team and end users. 
Freeplane is a tool for making mind maps. It helps users collect, organize, and show their ideas. 
Users can add topics, connect them, and change how they look. They can also add links, files, and notes to each idea.
Users can search the map or hide parts they don’t need. They can save their maps in many formats like PDF or HTML. They can share these maps with others.
Advanced users can write scripts. These scripts can do tasks faster or add new features. Freeplane works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It does not need the internet to run.
Freeplane is good for planning, learning, and thinking. Both beginners and advanced users can use it.

The SRS is for these people:
1. Developers – They need to know what features to build and how the system should work.  
2. Testers – They need to check if the software works as expected and has no bugs.  
3. Project managers – They need to plan the work, set deadlines, and make sure the team follows the plan.  
4. Users – They want to know what the software can do and if it fits their needs.  
5. Contributors – They want to help improve the software, so they need to understand how it works now.

1.5 Document Overview


Overall Description
2.1 Product perspective

Freeplane is a free and open-source mind mapping tool. It comes from another project called FreeMind. 
You can use Freeplane to draw maps that help you plan, organize ideas, and manage knowledge.
Freeplane works on computers with Windows, macOS, or Linux. It does not need the internet or a server to run. You can use it by itself. 
If you are an advanced user, you can also add extra tools, plugins, or write scripts to do more things.You can use Freeplane alone. 
It does not need other software to work. But it can work with other tools. For example, you can export maps and open them in PDF or HTML. 
You can also write scripts to connect it with other programs.

Freeplane is one part of many tools used for thinking, learning, or working. 
It can open and save maps in different formats, like PDF, HTML, Markdown, and OPML. This helps you share your work with other software.
This document (called SRS) explains what Freeplane should do, how it should work, and what limits it has. It helps developers build, test, and improve the software.

2.4 Operating Environment
There are no specific hardware requirements on the program and can run on all modern operating systems (windows, mac & linux). Assumed recommended requirements:
CPU, 2 GHz or higher (better performance)
RAM, 1 GB or more (smoother when working with big mind maps)
Storage, 200 MB or more (for installation and more depends on mind maps)
Graphics, enough to handle basic 2d rendering

The software requirements for the system requires an embedded java distribution in the installer or independently java 11 or later needs to be installed (preferably java 11 or 17). [1] 
Without an installer and using git clone, ‘gradle’ additionally with java needs to be installed to build the program.

The program is mainly an offline local application and may only need the network to check for updates.


2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Technology Limitation - Java Dependency:
Constraint: Freeplane is built using Java, which requires users to have a compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their systems. This limits the application’s portability to environments where Java is supported and imposes a dependency on maintaining compatibility with evolving Java versions (e.g., Java 8 or later as specified in the Freeplane GitHub repository).
Impact: The design must adhere to Java-specific conventions, and updates to the Java platform (e.g., deprecated APIs) may necessitate refactoring. Additionally, performance may be constrained by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) overhead compared to native applications.
Standards Compliance - Export Formats:
Constraint: Freeplane supports exporting mind maps to formats such as PDF, PNG, and HTML, which must comply with industry standards for these file types (e.g., PDF/A for archival purposes or HTML5 for web compatibility). Deviations from these standards could lead to interoperability issues with other tools.
Impact: The implementation must include libraries or modules (e.g., iText for PDF generation) that conform to these standards, potentially limiting the choice of tools or increasing development complexity.
Regulatory Requirements - Accessibility:
Constraint: As a tool potentially used in educational or professional settings, Freeplane may need to comply with accessibility regulations such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) or Section 508 (if deployed in certain jurisdictions like the U.S.). This includes ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
Impact: The user interface design must incorporate accessibility features, which could constrain the complexity of visual elements or require additional development effort.

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies (Tips: Assumptions are the prerequisites that we
take for granted when designing requirements. For example, for a certain function, do
you think users need to have certain prerequisite capabilities before using it? )
Assumption - User Familiarity with Mind Mapping:
Assumption: Users of Freeplane are assumed to have a basic understanding of mind-mapping concepts (e.g., nodes, branches, hierarchies) to effectively utilize the software. The interface and documentation do not explicitly cater to absolute beginners in this domain.
Implication: The system’s design assumes that users can navigate and interpret hierarchical structures without extensive onboarding, which may exclude features like step-by-step tutorials for novices.
Assumption - Availability of Storage and Memory:
Assumption: The system assumes that users have sufficient local storage and memory to handle large mind maps, especially when working with complex projects that include multimedia attachments (e.g., images or PDFs).
Implication: No specific mechanisms are built into Freeplane to handle low-resource environments, potentially limiting usability on older or resource-constrained devices.
Dependency - Java Ecosystem:
Dependency: Freeplane relies on the Java ecosystem, including the JRE and libraries such as Swing for the graphical user interface. Any updates, discontinuations, or security patches in these components directly affect Freeplane’s functionality and maintenance.
Implication: The development team must monitor Java updates and ensure compatibility, which may delay feature releases or require additional testing.
Dependency - Operating System Compatibility:
Dependency: Freeplane depends on operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) that support Java. Changes in OS-specific Java implementations (e.g., macOS dropping support for older Java versions) could disrupt functionality.
Implication: The system assumes a stable OS-Java relationship, and compatibility issues may require OS-specific workarounds or updates.

Should be able to create render and add nodes without lag, crashing or unable render content due lack of memory. 

3.1.5 Design constraints
3.1.5.1 Storage and Memory
Extra storage is needed to store the mind map file if the mind map is too big with a large number of nodes, it may require storage to be a problem with the software unable to store it. 
Low memory may also cause the software to be unable to load big mind maps with large numbers of nodes or lagging and crashing the software. These hardware constraints may cause the software to be unable to operate.

3.1.5.2 Operating Requirements
Java is needed to operate the software as the software is code in Java. This may only increase storage for the application as Java needs to be installed.

3.1.6 Quality Attributes
3.1.6.1 Usuability
Node creation should be used with ease and easy to navigate. The user should not be frustrated when navigating node creation and the software should be responsive enough to update new changes.

3.1.6.2 Maintainability 
Node creation should be well maintained, hence being easy to edit and open to changes and updates when issues arise or to be improved. 

-Feature 2:
3.2.1 Feature name
Filtering and Searching
3.2.2 Description

Input: User selects a filter, such as priority == high
Processing: The system hides nodes that do not meet the requirements according to the conditions.
Output: Only nodes that meet the conditions and their ancestors/descendants are displayed, and other nodes are hidden.
