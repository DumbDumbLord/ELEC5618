1.5 Document Overview


Overall Description
2.1 Product perspective

2.2 Product Features

2.3 User classes and Characteristics
Users
Characteristics - these users want to use the software to create mind maps for personal or educational purposes. May lack the expertise of more advanced users and programmers. 
Responsibilities:
Creating and editing mind maps.
Organising thoughts, ideas, or information into the mind maps.
Adding nodes and connections to the map.
Exporting mind maps to intended file types

Advanced Users
Characteristics  - these are more advanced users who have a deeper understanding of freeplane and/or want to use more advanced features of the software. 
These advanced features should include plugins and addons. 
Responsibilities:
Creating and editing more detailed mind maps.
Installing addons and/or plugins to freeplane to extend functionality
Collaborating with other users more dynamically with addons.
Able to extend exports options if needed

Developer/Programmer
Characteristics  - programmers that have programming knowledge and want to extend the software functionality or implement quality of life changes to make the software more convenient.
Responsibilities:
Writing scripts/addons to automate or make actions more convenient within the mind maps
Developing and implementing additional functionality on freeplane
Creating or updating software/addon to a new version.
Fixing bugs 

Viewer
Characteristics  - any user which only wants to view mind maps using the software.
Responsibilities:
Viewing mind maps
Exporting mind maps to different file types

2.4 Operating Environment
There are no specific hardware requirements on the program and can run on all modern operating systems (windows, mac & linux). Assumed recommended requirements:
CPU, 2 GHz or higher (better performance)
RAM, 1 GB or more (smoother when working with big mind maps)
Storage, 200 MB or more (for installation and more depends on mind maps)
Graphics, enough to handle basic 2d rendering

The software requirements for the system requires an embedded java distribution in the installer or independently java 11 or later needs to be installed (preferably java 11 or 17). [1] 
Without an installer and using git clone, ‘gradle’ additionally with java needs to be installed to build the program.

The program is mainly an offline local application and may only need the network to check for updates.

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies (Tips: Assumptions are the prerequisites that we
take for granted when designing requirements. For example, for a certain function, do
you think users need to have certain prerequisite capabilities before using it? )

System features (Each student should provide one feature)
Feature 1:
3.1.1 Feature name
Node Creation in Mind map

3.1.2 Description
Allows the user to create and edit a visual mind map represented by nodes which helps organise their ideas, information or plans. 

3.1.3 Functional Requirements
3.1.3.1 Create Nodes in Mind Map
Clicking on the add nodes button will create a new node on the currently selected node.
Input: add node button press
Output: new child node to selected node

3.1.3.2 Edit Content of Existing Nodes
Clicking the node selects the node. Double clicking nodes allows editing the content of the node
Input: Double Clicking
Process: Editing the node, can change text with addition to its font size, text alignment and bold/italic.
Output: Content of Node changes

3.1.4 Performance Requirements
3.1.4.1 Response/Rendering Time for Node Creation/updates
Should be responsive and be below 1s to create nodes and update the new node content.

3.1.4.2 Efficient or Sufficient Memory 
Should be able to create render and add nodes without lag, crashing or unable render content due lack of memory. 

3.1.5 Design constraints
3.1.5.1 Storage and Memory
Extra storage is needed to store the mind map file if the mind map is too big with a large number of nodes, it may require storage to be a problem with the software unable to store it. 
Low memory may also cause the software to be unable to load big mind maps with large numbers of nodes or lagging and crashing the software. These hardware constraints may cause the software to be unable to operate.

3.1.5.2 Operating Requirements
Java is needed to operate the software as the software is code in Java. This may only increase storage for the application as Java needs to be installed.

3.1.6 Quality Attributes
3.1.6.1 Usuability
Node creation should be used with ease and easy to navigate. The user should not be frustrated when navigating node creation and the software should be responsive enough to update new changes.

3.1.6.2 Maintainability 
Node creation should be well maintained, hence being easy to edit and open to changes and updates when issues arise or to be improved. 

-Feature 2:
3.2.1 Feature name
Filtering and Searching
3.2.2 Description
This function allows users to filter and search nodes in mind maps by keywords, attributes or conditional expressions. Its purpose is to help users quickly locate information from a large number of nodes, hide irrelevant content, and focus on specific tasks or content structures.
3.2.3 Functional Requirements
FR1: Keyword search function
Description: The system should allow users to enter keywords in the search box and highlight all nodes matching the keyword in the map.
Input: The user enters text in the search bar, such as "deadline".
Processing: The system searches for nodes containing the text in all nodes.
Output: Matching nodes are highlighted and their ancestor nodes are automatically expanded.
FR2: Conditional filter function
Description: The system should allow users to apply filter conditions (such as node priority, label, completion status) to display specific nodes.
Input: User selects a filter, such as priority == high
Processing: The system hides nodes that do not meet the requirements according to the conditions.
Output: Only nodes that meet the conditions and their ancestors/descendants are displayed, and other nodes are hidden.
3.2.4 Performance Requirements
PR1: Response time
For mind maps with no more than 1,000 nodes, the response time for search operations should be no more than 300 milliseconds, and for filter operations no more than 500 milliseconds.
PR2: Memory efficiency
The system should avoid memory leaks when performing filter operations, use lightweight data structures for filter states, and release cached data immediately after filtering is undone.
3.2.5 Design constraints
DC1: Platform compatibility constraints
The function must be compatible with the Java runtime environment (JRE 8 and above) to ensure that it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
DC2: Data structure restrictions
The filtering function must be implemented based on the existing NodeModel and MapModel data structures, and the introduction of new core node types is prohibited.
3.2.6 Quality Attributes
QA1:  Performance Search and filter operations should be completed within 1 second (for less than 1,000 nodes) to ensure high interactive response speed.
QA2:  Usability Users can quickly access filter and search functions through shortcut keys or graphic buttons, and the operation logic should be consistent with the document description.

NodeModel interface: used to access and manipulate nodes in the mind map, providing fundamental methods such as getText(), setStyle(), etc. 
(Freeplane API document: org.freeplane.features.map.NodeModel)
MapModel class: abstract representation of the mind map, all nodes (NodeModel) are attached to it in a tree structure.
(Freeplane API document: org.freeplane.features.map.MapModel)
NodeCondition interface: used to define conditional expressions when filtering nodes, supporting plug-in and script calls.
(Freeplane API document: org.freeplane.api.NodeCondition)
ScriptEngine interface (javax.script): executes Groovy/JavaScript scripts to implement advanced filtering and custom node logic.
(JSR-223 standard API:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/script/package-summary.html)
FilterController module: handles node filtering and hiding logic, integrated with UI and Undo system.(Internal module, no separate documentation)

4.4 Communication Interfaces
Plugin remote download: Freeplane plugins support remote pull from GitHub or plugin repositories via HTTP/HTTPS protocol, using port 443.

URI file binding interface: allows users to bind local or remote .mm file paths, such as template:/my-template.mm.

User script external request: Groovy/JavaScript scripts support external API requests via URLs, such as new URL(...).text to read external tasks or notes.

Version check and update (optional): The system can access the official website address to detect the plugin/main program version, the protocol is HTTPS, and supports JSON format response.
