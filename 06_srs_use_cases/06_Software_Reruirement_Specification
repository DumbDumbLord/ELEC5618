Introduction
1.1 Purpose(Tips: Who may want to see this SRS document and why they see it?)
The Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is a guide for the software that is under development and maintained. 
The intended audience for the document should mainly be stakeholders of the project, hence the owners, development team and end users. 
Freeplane is a tool for making mind maps. It helps users collect, organize, and show their ideas. 
Users can add topics, connect them, and change how they look. They can also add links, files, and notes to each idea.
Users can search the map or hide parts they don’t need. They can save their maps in many formats like PDF or HTML. They can share these maps with others.
Advanced users can write scripts. These scripts can do tasks faster or add new features. Freeplane works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It does not need the internet to run.
Freeplane is good for planning, learning, and thinking. Both beginners and advanced users can use it.
The SRS is for these people:
1. Developers – They need to know what features to build and how the system should work.  
2. Testers – They need to check if the software works as expected and has no bugs.  
3. Project managers – They need to plan the work, set deadlines, and make sure the team follows the plan.  
4. Users – They want to know what the software can do and if it fits their needs.  
5. Contributors – They want to help improve the software, so they need to understand how it works now.

1.5 Document Overview

Overall Description
2.1 Product perspective
Freeplane is a free and open-source mind mapping tool. It comes from another project called FreeMind. 
You can use Freeplane to draw maps that help you plan, organize ideas, and manage knowledge.
Freeplane works on computers with Windows, macOS, or Linux. It does not need the internet or a server to run. You can use it by itself. 
If you are an advanced user, you can also add extra tools, plugins, or write scripts to do more things.You can use Freeplane alone. 
It does not need other software to work. But it can work with other tools. For example, you can export maps and open them in PDF or HTML. 
You can also write scripts to connect it with other programs.
Freeplane is one part of many tools used for thinking, learning, or working. 
It can open and save maps in different formats, like PDF, HTML, Markdown, and OPML. This helps you share your work with other software.
This document (called SRS) explains what Freeplane should do, how it should work, and what limits it has. It helps developers build, test, and improve the software.

-Feature 2:
3.2.1 Feature name
Filtering and Searching
3.2.2 Description
This function allows users to filter and search nodes in mind maps by keywords, attributes or conditional expressions. Its purpose is to help users quickly locate information from a large number of nodes, hide irrelevant content, and focus on specific tasks or content structures.
3.2.3 Functional Requirements
FR1: Keyword search function
Description: The system should allow users to enter keywords in the search box and highlight all nodes matching the keyword in the map.
Input: The user enters text in the search bar, such as "deadline".
Processing: The system searches for nodes containing the text in all nodes.
Output: Matching nodes are highlighted and their ancestor nodes are automatically expanded.
FR2: Conditional filter function
Description: The system should allow users to apply filter conditions (such as node priority, label, completion status) to display specific nodes.
Input: User selects a filter, such as priority == high
Processing: The system hides nodes that do not meet the requirements according to the conditions.
Output: Only nodes that meet the conditions and their ancestors/descendants are displayed, and other nodes are hidden.
3.2.4 Performance Requirements
PR1: Response time
For mind maps with no more than 1,000 nodes, the response time for search operations should be no more than 300 milliseconds, and for filter operations no more than 500 milliseconds.
PR2: Memory efficiency
The system should avoid memory leaks when performing filter operations, use lightweight data structures for filter states, and release cached data immediately after filtering is undone.
3.2.5 Design constraints
DC1: Platform compatibility constraints
The function must be compatible with the Java runtime environment (JRE 8 and above) to ensure that it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
DC2: Data structure restrictions
The filtering function must be implemented based on the existing NodeModel and MapModel data structures, and the introduction of new core node types is prohibited.
3.2.6 Quality Attributes
QA1:  Performance Search and filter operations should be completed within 1 second (for less than 1,000 nodes) to ensure high interactive response speed.
QA2:  Usability Users can quickly access filter and search functions through shortcut keys or graphic buttons, and the operation logic should be consistent with the document description.
