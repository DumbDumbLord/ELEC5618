Initial Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Walkthrough Procedures: (Describe the walkthrough procedures followed in the project. Explain the steps involved, how they are conducted, and the key participants.)


Code Review Process: (Describe the code review process, including how it is carried out, the tools used, and the roles of team members involved.)

The code review process mainly includes standard git collaboration methods. Freeplane is an open source project hosted on github, with the current 
version 1.12.x being the main default branch. Changes are made in new branches which can originate from the main branch, or from another branch/version. 
The changes from branches are merged to main via pull requests, where the main developer and project owner Dimitry Polivaev, is able to review the code, 
then messages the contributor and rejects or accepts the pull request. Git allows for seamless collaboration and version control which provide great 
flexibility and ensures that the code stays working and effective. Hence the code review mainly focuses on the usage of pull requests and 
branches to review code with seemingly only the developer Dimitry Polivaev participating in it. For our team the quality manager will be the main person 
responsible for code reviewing, while some team members occasionally accept some pull requests. 

Software Evaluation Process: (Explain the processes used to assess software quality, such as user testing, performance benchmarking, and automated analysis tools.)


Quality Assurance Roles in the Team: (Outline the specific quality-related roles within the team, such as Quality Manager, Quality Engineer, Test Lead, and their responsibilities.)


Software Testing Methods: (Examine the source code to determine the presence of testing mechanisms such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Describe their implementation or, if absent, recommend necessary testing methods.)


Identified Gaps and Recommendations: (Highlight any shortcomings in the quality assurance process and provide suggestions for improvement.)
