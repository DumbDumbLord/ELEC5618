4. Upgrade Process:(Each team selects an open-source project and identifies a software quality feature to improve. The team then collaborates to implement the upgrade, with each member playing a specific role. Describe the collaboration process, role assignments, and how the feature was built from scratch.)
  a. Collaboration Process
      Quality Planning:
        Kick-off Meeting:
          Assemble key participants: Project Manager, Lead Developer, QA, UX/UI Designer, DevOps, and Community Representatives.
          Review current quality issues and user feedback (from GitHub Issues, Discussions, and direct user input) to identify the improvement areas.
          
        Define Scope and Priorities:
          Prioritize the 15 improvement aspects based on impact, effort, and community feedback.
          Develop detailed requirement documents for each aspect.
         
      Quality Assurance:
        Prototype Development:
          Develop a proof-of-concept or a minimal viable version of new features to validate design decisions.
          
        Incremental Implementation:
          Use feature branches for each major improvement.
          Follow coding standards and best practices; maintain modularity for future extensions.
          
        Peer Review Process:
          Developers submit pull requests which are reviewed by peers, the lead developer, and QA.
          Automated code analysis tools (e.g., static analysis, test coverage reports) support this process.
          
        Merge and Integration:
          After successful reviews and testing, merge feature branches into the main branch.
          
        Automated Testing:
          Implement unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests using a CI pipeline.
          
        Manual Testing:
          QA conducts exploratory and regression testing.
          Security tests are performed to ensure vulnerability-free updates.
          
        Walkthrough Sessions:
          Testing Walkthrough: QA and developers jointly review test cases, results, and bug reports to ensure comprehensive coverage.

      Quality Control
        Rigorous Testing Regimes
          Both automated and manual testing are used to monitor project results. Unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests are implemented to check that the specific outputs comply with quality standards.

        Monitoring and Feedback Loops
          Regular bug tracking, error logging, and community feedback help the team promptly address any deviations from the quality standards.

        Enforcing Standards
          Code reviews and strict merge criteria ensure that all development follows the agreed-upon procedures and quality requirements.

  b. Role Assignments
    Project Lead
      - Overall coordination
      - Task prioritization
      - Backend/core code contributions
    UX/UI Designer
      - Redesigning the interface
      - Accessibility improvements
    Backend
      - Performance optimization
      - Feature integration
    QA & Testing Engineer
      - Writing and running tests
      - Bug triage
    Documentation & Tools
      - Writing docs
      - Managing dev tools/CI/CD

  c. The process builds features from scratch by following these key steps:

      Planning & Design:
      Define requirements and quality standards, then create prototypes and design walkthroughs to validate ideas.

      Incremental Development:
      Develop the feature in isolated branches, adhering to coding best practices and using peer reviews for quality checks.

      Continuous Testing & Integration:
      Run automated and manual tests through a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring the new code meets all quality standards before merging into the main branch.

      Final Review:
      Conduct a final walkthrough to confirm that the feature integrates seamlessly and meets the set requirements.


5. Proposed Improvements:(Each team member must propose at least three aspects of the product that need improvement. The aspects proposed by each team member cannot be repeated.)

  (1) Performance Optimization
    Issue: Slow response times and inefficient memory management
    Solution: Optimize code and algorithms, improve memory handling, and boost overall performance
    
  (2) Code Modularity & Refactoring
    Issue: Monolithic legacy code that is difficult to maintain
    Solution: Refactor the codebase into modular components to reduce technical debt and simplify future enhancements
    
  (3) Enhanced Plugin Architecture
    Issue: Inflexible plugin system limiting extensibility
    Solution: Redesign the plugin framework for easier integration and extension by developers
    
  (4) Automated testing and increased coverage
    Issue:
    Solution:
    
  (5) User experience enhancements
    Issue:
    Solution:
  
  (6) Improved documentation
    Issue:
    Solution:
  
  (7)Internationalization & Localization
    Issue:Limited language support and regional customization
    Solution:Add multi-language support and localization features for broader accessibility

  (8)Simplified Installation Process
    Issue:Complicated installation procedures deterring new users
    Solution:Simplify and automate the installation process for easier setup across different platforms
    
  (9)Accessibility Improvements
     Issue:Lack of compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen readers)
     Solution:Implement accessibility features such as keyboard shortcuts, high-contrast modes, and screen reader support

  (13) Improved UI
    Issue:Currently the UI is not very appealing and with a lot of information clustered together
    Solution: Increase outline for tabs, increase margins for mindmap boxes/nodes and also move around for font, size, etc to a left tab to improve space
    
  (14) Resizing Nodes
    Issue: Nodes currently can't be resized
    Solution: Make nodes resizable
    
  (15) Default/Template node/mindmap designs
    Issue: The software currently lack any templates for nodes or mindmap from the software itself, which would be helpful to the user
    Solution: Add in templates for nodes/mindmaps
