• Expected procedure  
1. Weekly Check-in: Everyone must submit a weekly progress on our github project(before Mondays).This ensures that people are well informed on what tasks have been completed, what needs to be completed, and allows for discussion on areas of improvement.

  Method for conflict resolution:
  If a check-in is not given on time, we will send a reminder to the person/people to update the group on their progress. 

  If the check-in is not presented in a desirable manner or to sufficient quality, have an open, constructive discussion on how to improve it.

2. Group Synergy: Discuss and allocate work tasks in advance. One should properly report one's work progress and complete work before the deadline.
  If someone is unable to complete their assigned tasks, raise objections during the assignment or raise them before a certain deadline (usually Sundays).
  
  Method for conflict resolution:
  If someone fails to complete the work as required without consultation, they should promptly complete the task and make self-criticism. In the next task, they will be closely monitored.

3. Proactivity in meetings:
  If a member is absent from a meeting, they should inform the group in advance. After the meeting, they can review the meeting notes or recording and follow up on any assigned tasks.


• Expectations  
We expect all team members to actively participate, communicate effectively, and complete assigned tasks on time. Everyone should stay engaged, provide updates on their progress, and support each other to ensure smooth collaboration.
