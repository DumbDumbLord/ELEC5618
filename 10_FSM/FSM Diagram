FSM Diagram
• Select one functionality of your product for which to write a detailed test using FSMs.
• Communicate your choice of functionality to the rest of the team so that all members use a different one.
• Write a detailed description of the FSM used to test this functionality. The FSM must have at least
three different paths all related to the same functionality. The decision of which path to select must be
based on input data (which can be obtained visually by the tester if it refers to GUI elements).
• Include the description of the FSM in a formal test case description template containing information about
the type of test, purpose, prerequisite, input data, etc.

Function5
1. Selected Functionality
I've chosen to test Freeplane's mind map export functionality, which has been created for:
Exporting the current mind map to various file formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG).
Allowing the user to choose the export format.
Ensuring the exported file is created and contains the mind map content.

3.Test Cases
Test Case 1: Export to PNG Path
Test Item
Description
Test Case ID
EXPORT-01
Type of Test
Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
S0 → S1 → S2 → S5 → S6 → S0
Purpose
Verify that a mind map can be successfully exported to PNG format.
Prerequisite
1. Freeplane installed and running. &lt;br> 2. A mind map is created or loaded.
Input Data
1. An open mind map. &lt;br> 2. Mouse clicks for menu navigation and selection. &lt;br> 3. Filename for export.
Steps
1. With a mind map open (S0), navigate to "File" -> "Export Map..." (E0) to open the export dialog (S1). &lt;br> 2. Select "PNG" as the export format (E1) (S2). &lt;br> 3. Click the "Save" or "Export" button to proceed (E4), opening the system save dialog (S5). &lt;br> 4. Enter a filename (e.g., "MyMap.png") and choose a save location. Click "Save" (E5). &lt;br> 5. Verify that the export process completes, and a PNG file is created in the specified location (S6). &lt;br> 6. Verify the Freeplane interface returns to the main map view (E8) (S0). &lt;br> 7. Open the exported PNG file and verify it accurately represents the mind map.
Expected Result
The mind map is successfully exported as a PNG file. The file is viewable and accurately reflects the mind map content and structure.

Test Case 2: Export to PDF Path and Cancel
Test Item
Description
Test Case ID
EXPORT-02
Type of Test
Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
S0 → S1 → S3 → S5 → S7 → S0
Purpose
Verify that the PDF export process can be cancelled from the system save dialog.
Prerequisite
1. Freeplane installed and running. &lt;br> 2. A mind map is created or loaded.
Input Data
1. An open mind map. &lt;br> 2. Mouse clicks.
Steps
1. With a mind map open (S0), navigate to "File" -> "Export Map..." (E0) to open the export dialog (S1). &lt;br> 2. Select "PDF" as the export format (E2) (S3). &lt;br> 3. Click the "Save" or "Export" button (E4) to open the system save dialog (S5). &lt;br> 4. Click the "Cancel" button in the system save dialog (E7) (S7). &lt;br> 5. Verify that no PDF file is created. &lt;br> 6. Verify the Freeplane interface returns to the main map view (E8) (S0).
Expected Result
The export process is cancelled. No PDF file is generated, and the application returns to the map editing state without error.

Test Case 3: Cancel Export from Format Selection
Test Item
Description
Test Case ID
EXPORT-03
Type of Test
Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
S0 → S1 → S7 → S0
Purpose
Verify that the export process can be cancelled directly from the export format selection dialog.
Prerequisite
1. Freeplane installed and running. &lt;br> 2. A mind map is created or loaded.
Input Data
1. An open mind map. &lt;br> 2. Mouse clicks.
Steps
1. With a mind map open (S0), navigate to "File" -> "Export Map..." (E0) to open the export dialog (S1). &lt;br> 2. Close the export dialog without selecting a format or clicking "Save" (e.g., by clicking the 'X' button or pressing 'Esc' if applicable) (E6) (S7). &lt;br> 3. Verify that no file is created. &lt;br> 4. Verify the Freeplane interface returns to the main map view (E8) (S0).
Expected Result
The export process is cancelled. No file is generated, and the application returns to the map editing state without error.
