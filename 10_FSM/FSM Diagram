FSM Diagram
• Select one functionality of your product for which to write a detailed test using FSMs.
• Communicate your choice of functionality to the rest of the team so that all members use a different one.
• Write a detailed description of the FSM used to test this functionality. The FSM must have at least
three different paths all related to the same functionality. The decision of which path to select must be
based on input data (which can be obtained visually by the tester if it refers to GUI elements).
• Include the description of the FSM in a formal test case description template containing information about
the type of test, purpose, prerequisite, input data, etc.
