FSM Diagram
• Select one functionality of your product for which to write a detailed test using FSMs.
• Communicate your choice of functionality to the rest of the team so that all members use a different one.
• Write a detailed description of the FSM used to test this functionality. The FSM must have at least
three different paths all related to the same functionality. The decision of which path to select must be
based on input data (which can be obtained visually by the tester if it refers to GUI elements).
• Include the description of the FSM in a formal test case description template containing information about
the type of test, purpose, prerequisite, input data, etc.

Function2
1. Selected Functionality
I've chosen to test Freeplane’s node deletion and undo functionality, which supports:
Deleting a selected node from the mind map
Undoing a deletion to restore the node
Redoing the deletion after undo
Ensuring the correct node is restored or removed at each step

3.Test Cases
Test Case 1: Basic Delete and Undo Path
Test Item
 Description
Test Case ID
 DEL-01
Type of Test
 Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
 S0 → S1 → S2 → S3
Purpose
 Verify that a selected node can be deleted and successfully restored using the Undo function.
Prerequisite
Freeplane is installed and running


A map with at least one node present


Input Data
A selected node


Delete key and Ctrl+Z keyboard inputs


Steps
Click on an existing node to select it (S0 → S1)


Press the Delete key to remove the selected node (S1 → S2)


Press Ctrl+Z to perform Undo (S2 → S3)


Verify that the previously deleted node reappears


Expected Result
 The node is deleted and then successfully restored using the Undo function.
Actual Result
 [To be filled after execution]
Status
 [Pass/Fail]
Test Case 2: Deletion Without Node Selection
Test Item
 Description
Test Case ID
 DEL-02
Type of Test
 Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
 S0 → S0
Purpose
 Verify that pressing the Delete key when no node is selected does not affect the map.
Prerequisite
Freeplane is installed and running


No node is selected


Input Data
Delete key pressed without selecting any node


Steps
Ensure no node is currently selected (S0)


Press the Delete key


Observe the interface for any unintended changes


Expected Result
 No action is performed, and the system remains in the same state.
Actual Result
 [To be filled after execution]
Status
 [Pass/Fail]
Test Case 3: Delete → Undo → Redo Path
Test Item
 Description
Test Case ID
 DEL-03
Type of Test
 Black-box Testing (GUI Functional Test)
Path Tested
 S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 → S2
Purpose
 Verify that a deleted node can be restored using Undo and then deleted again using Redo.
Prerequisite
Freeplane is installed and running
A node is available for testing
Input Data
Node selection
Delete key, Ctrl+Z, and Ctrl+Y inputs
Steps
Select a node (S0 → S1)
Press the Delete key (S1 → S2)
Press Ctrl+Z to undo (S2 → S3)
Press Ctrl+Y to redo the deletion (S3 → S2)
Expected Result
 The node is deleted, successfully restored, and then removed again using Redo.
Actual Result
 [To be filled after execution]
Status
 [Pass/Fail]
Test Case 4: Undo Fails after Redo
Test Item
 Description
Test Case ID
 DEL-04
Type of Test

Purpose
 Verify that the Undo function fails or is disabled when redo has exhausted the undo stack.
Prerequisite
Freeplane is installed and running
A node has been deleted and redone
Input Data
Node deletion
Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y commands
Steps
Select and delete a node (S1 → S2)
Press Ctrl+Z to undo (S2 → S3)
Press Ctrl+Y to redo (S3 → S2)
