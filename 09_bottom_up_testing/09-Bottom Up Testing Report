    Test Suite
    1. Ensure dependencies are present in build.gradle:
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.3'
    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:5.2.0'

    test {
        useJUnitPlatform()
    }

    2. Place the test file at:	freeplane/freeplane/src/test/java/org/freeplane/features/map/NodeModelClassTest.java

    3. Run tests from the project root or module directory:
    cd freeplane/freeplane
    gradle test

    or to run only this test class:
    gradle test --tests org.freeplane.features.map.NodeModelClassTest

    4. View the test report: Open freeplane/freeplane/build/reports/tests/test/index.html in your browser to see the results.

    Tests:
    testSetAndGetText
    Verifies that the setText and getText methods correctly set and retrieve the node's text content.

    testInsertAndGetChild
    Checks that inserting a child node increases the parent's child count, allows retrieval by index, and sets the correct parent reference for the child.

    testFoldedState
    Tests the isFolded and setFolded methods to ensure the node's folded (collapsed/expanded) state can be toggled and queried accurately.

    testSetAndGetSide
    Ensures that the node's side (e.g., TOP_OR_LEFT) can be set and retrieved using setSide and getSide.

    testSetAndGetUserObject
    Verifies that an arbitrary user object can be attached to the node and retrieved with setUserObject and getUserObject.

    testChildrenListUnmodifiable
    Confirms that the list returned by getChildren is unmodifiable, i.e., attempts to add elements throw an exception.

    testIsLeaf
    Checks if the node correctly reports being a leaf (no children) and updates this status after a child is inserted.

    testSetAndGetXmlText
    Tests setting and retrieving the node's XML text representation, ensuring it is stored and returned in the expected format.

    testDepth
    Verifies that the depth method accurately reports the node's depth in the tree structure (root = 0, child = 1, grandchild = 2, etc.).

Additional Classes
    MapModel
    (freeplane\src\main\java\org\freeplane\features\map\MapModel.java)
    Manages the structure and data of the mind map, storing and organizing NodeModel objects in a tree. It provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing nodes, and notifies listeners about changes to nodes or the map.

    MapController
    (freeplane\src\main\java\org\freeplane\features\map\MapController.java)
    Handles user actions and logic for the mind map. It operates on NodeModel objects by selecting, folding/unfolding, sorting, and updating nodes. It coordinates changes between the UI and the underlying MapModel, ensuring that operations on nodes are reflected in both the data and the interface.
Bottom-Up Testing
    testInsertNodeAndGetChild:
      Verifies that inserting a child node into a parent updates the parent's child count and allows correct retrieval of the child.
    testMapControllerSelect:
      Ensures that the select method of MapController can be called with a NodeModel and that the call is properly registered (using Mockito verification).
    testSortNodesByDepth:
      Demonstrates how to call the sortNodesByDepth method on a list of nodes. (Note: The actual sorting logic is not tested here since a real MapController object is not used.)

matches() matches property of node to check if it matches node.

filterMatchingNodes() filters all matching nodes that has property

NodeMatcherBlank(): Test matches() with blank test string, in addition should test no_content enum

NodeMatcherAlias(): Test matches() with a node alias, in addition should test alias enum

NodeMatcherTextFullTrue1(): Test matches() with text that has double quotation marks.

NodeMatcherTextFullTrue2(): Test matches() with text that has single quotation marks.

NodeMatcherTextPartTrue1(): Test matches() with text that has double quotation marks and ellipsis.

NodeMatcherTextPartTrue2(): Test matches() with text that has single quotation marks and ellipsis.

NodeMatcherTextFullFalse(): Test matches() with text when text doesn’t match node

NodeMatcherInvalid(): Test matches() with invalid search string

NodeMatcherCounterMatch(): Test matches() with counter, will return error as counter is used for filterMatchingNodes()

NodeMatcherList(): Test filterMatchingNodes() with text.

NodeMatcherCounter(): Test filterMatchingNodes() with counter, within node list range.

NodeMatcherCounterEmpty(): Test filterMatchingNodes() with counter, outside node list range.

Additional Classes

Command
(freeplane/src/main/java/org/freeplane/features/explorer/Command.java)

A Class which functions with ExploringStep to control operations of NodeMatcher. Calls NodeMatcher 

ExploringStep
(freeplane/src/main/java/org/freeplane/features/explorer/ExploringStep.java)

An Enum Class where its methods vary depending on its enum type. Calls NodeMatcher 

Bottom-Up Testing

(was place in freeplane/src/test/java/org/freeplane/features/explorer/Command.java)
[code](./Class 4 files/CommandSpec.java)

    @Test
    public void NodeMatcherBlank() throws Exception {
        AccessedNodes accessedNodes = mock(AccessedNodes.class);
        NodeModel parent = new NodeModel("", null);

        parent.insert(new NodeModel("a", null));
        parent.insert(new NodeModel("b", null));
        parent.insert(new NodeModel("c", null));
        parent.insert(new NodeModel("d", null));

        Command command = new Command(ExploringStep.CHILD, "\'b\'", accessedNodes);

        assertEquals(command.getNodes(parent).toString(), "[b]");
    }

Code test dependency of NodeMatcher, Command and ExploringStep. Command creates NodeMatcher when it is created with search string “\’b\’”, while ExploringStep is type CHILD hence getNode (of ExploringStep) will search for the child nodes of the node selected when Command method getNodes is called.
